In a non-random way, it is not important for the system to have finite boundaries because this allows us to see how the system behaves at large $t$, and the system will approach equilibrium when the dropping stops."

A system is in equilibrium when its state of motion or internal energy does not change in time. Our sandpile will likely be statitically stationary after some time $t_s$ but it will not be in equilibrium unless $\\delta (i, j) = s(i, j) = 0$ and $Z(t) -> constant$ (there are no more addition or deletion of sand and the states of each cell are constant.\n",
